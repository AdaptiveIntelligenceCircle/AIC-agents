#### What is an Agent in AIC?

In AIC-agents, an agent is **not** defined by intelligence level, model size, or autonomy.

An agent is defined by:

* Identity
* Bounded authority
* Observable behavior
* Accountability
* Reversibility

An AIC agent is a *responsible actor*, not an optimizer.

#### Core Principles

1. **Bounded Autonomy**
   An agent may reason freely, but may act only within explicitly granted capabilities.

2. **Action > Intention**
   Agents are judged by what they do, not what they claim to intend.

3. **No Anonymous Power**
   Every agent must be identifiable and revocable.

4. **Failure is Expected**
   Agents are designed assuming mistakes will happen.

5. **Human Supremacy**
   Humans retain override authority at all times.

#### What AIC Agents Are Not

* Not self-sovereign AI
* Not goal-maximizing black boxes
* Not autonomous weapons
* Not scalable swarms by default

They are **participants**, not rulers.

These documents define the non-negotiable foundations of AIC-agents.
