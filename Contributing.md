## CONTRIBUTING.md

### Who Can Contribute

We welcome contributors who value:

* Thoughtful engineering over hype
* Long-term system thinking
* Ethical responsibility
* Technical depth

You do **not** need to agree with every design decision, but you must respect the philosophy of the project.

---

### Ways to Contribute

* Core architecture discussions
* Agent reasoning models
* Trust & rollback mechanisms
* Simulation & adversarial testing
* Documentation & design critiques

Low-effort contributions that focus only on performance or scale without safety consideration may be rejected.

### Contribution Process

1. Read the README and design notes
2. Open an issue describing your idea or concern
3. Discuss before implementing major changes
4. Submit a pull request with:

   * Clear intent
   * Design rationale
   * Potential risks

---

### Design Principles to Respect

* Explicit over implicit behavior
* Inspectable logic over black boxes
* Safety before optimization
* Reversibility over irreversibility

---
### Final Note

If you are looking to build uncontrolled, extractive, or opaque AI systems, this project is likely **not** for you.

If you are willing to build slowly, responsibly, and honestly — welcome.
