#### Why Rollback is Fundamental

Any system that can act on the world must assume the possibility of harm.

Rollback is not an error-handling mechanism.
Rollback is an **ethical requirement**.

---

#### Types of Rollback

1. **State Rollback**
   Reverting system state to a previous snapshot.

2. **Permission Rollback**
   Revoking or reducing agent capabilities.

3. **Trust Rollback**
   Lowering trust based on outcomes.

4. **Agent Termination**
   Removing the agent entirely.

---

#### Rollback Triggers

* Policy violation
* Unexpected side effects
* Human override
* Trust threshold breach

---

#### Rollback ≠ Failure

Rollback represents:

* System maturity
* Ethical restraint
* Long-term resilience
