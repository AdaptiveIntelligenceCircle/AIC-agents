#### Trust as a Process

In AIC-agents, trust is:

* Dynamic
* Contextual
* Decaying
* Revocable

Trust is never absolute.

---

#### Trust Sources

* Historical behavior
* Simulation outcomes
* Human feedback
* Policy compliance

---

#### Trust Dimensions

1. **Reliability** – Does the agent do what it claims?
2. **Predictability** – Are outcomes stable?
3. **Alignment** – Does behavior match policy?
4. **Recoverability** – Can harm be undone?

---

#### Trust Flow

```
Action → Observation → Trust Update → Capability Adjustment
```

---

#### Final Principle

> Trust grants authority. Authority must always be withdrawable.

---

These documents define the non-negotiable foundations of AIC-agents.
